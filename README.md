# FIFA Player Analysis

This project involves analysis of a FIFA dataset to extract meaningful insights about the players. The project is divided into four parts: Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Exploring Statistical Data, and Python Data Structures.

## Overview

The project starts with cleaning and preprocessing the FIFA dataset. This includes handling missing values and converting data types.

The next part involves visualizing the data using matplotlib. We create bar charts and scatter plots to understand the distribution of players across different countries and the relationship between different player attributes.

In the third part, we perform exploratory analysis to calculate statistics like mean and median age of players, and identify the oldest player from Argentina.

The final part involves working with Python data structures. We create lists and dictionaries to store player information and write functions to retrieve specific data.
